# Python-data-analysis
This project focuses on **industry-oriented weather data analytics** using Python. It processes structured weather data to perform **data cleaning, validation, and exploratory analysis**. Advanced techniques such as **time-series feature engineering, rolling statistics, lag features, correlation analysis, and anomaly detection** are applied to uncover meaningful patterns. The project also includes **weather risk scoring and business KPI generation**, transforming raw meteorological data into actionable insights. The final output is a **model-ready dataset** suitable for machine learning, dashboards, and decision-support systems, demonstrating practical skills in data analytics, statistical analysis, and real-world data processing.
Implements robust data quality checks including missing-value detection, range validation, and outlier identification to ensure production-grade reliability.
Applies advanced time-series feature engineering (lags, rolling averages, peak-hour indicators) to prepare data for forecasting and ML models.
Translates raw weather parameters into business-centric metrics such as risk scores, anomaly flags, and operational KPIs.
Supports industry use cases like energy demand planning, insurance risk analysis, logistics optimization, and smart city monitoring.
Produces a clean, scalable, model-ready dataset suitable for BI dashboards, predictive analytics, and cloud deployment.
